This will be a notebook to compute the Helmholtz decomposition of MITgcm surface velocities in the cloud.

TODO:
 - Organize functions in a pure .py file
 - Reproduce steps on Pangeo to access the llc4320

Final product:
 - Select a snapshot of the LLC4320, perform the Helmholtz decomposition, 
and plot wavenumber spectra of rotational and divergent components
